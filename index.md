Hi, I'm Andrew. I was born and raised on the coast of North Carolina, near a little town called Emerald Isle.
I received my undergraduate degrees from [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/){:target="_blank"}
in Raleigh and moved to NYC shortly after graduation.

I currently live in Hell's Kitchen because [classical music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge_nJptSnOs){:target="_blank"}, and it's a good life.
I attend classical music performances from opera to ballet (more opera than ballet for sure)
and also enjoy cycling, cooking, gardening (yes, in NYC), and eating of course!
My interests include the broad fields of science and engineering, especially
relating to climate change, space exploration, and electronics (I also studied
Electrical Engineering).

I currently work as a software engineer at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com/){:target="_blank"} on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/){:target="_blank"}.
[I often attend](https://www.meetup.com/members/75287512/){:target="_blank"} tech events around the city
on topics ranging from Kubernetes to Go, so feel free to say hi if you see me!
